This Pipelined DES (Digital Encryption Standard) Digital Encryption Algorithm consists of the following VHDL source files for which copyright is claimed:

    frk.vhdl
    pipe_stage.vhdl
    last_stage.vhdl
    pipelined_des.vhdl
    input_vector.vhdl 
    key_vector.vhdl
    output_vector.vhdl 
    encrypt_vector.vhdl
    pipelined_des_tb.vhdl

As well as the C programs found in the code_tools subdirectory for which copyright is claimed:

    desvec.c
    desvec64.c
    keytab.c
    sbox_and_or.c
    sbox_case.c
    sbox_lookup.c     -- used to generate sbox1.vhdl - sbox8.vhdl
    sbox_switch.c
    sboxes.c


These files as well as ancillary files (Makefile, etc.)  are distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License, GPLv3 a copy of which is included in the distribution and explains your rights as a recipient of this distribution to redistribute and/or create derivative works.

The test vectors contained in input_vector.vhdl, key_vector.vhdl,  output_vector.vhdl and encrypt_vector.vhdl are derived from FIPS Special Pub 500-20, a government work without copyright and generated programmatically from desvec64.c, lacking the the necessary creative spark to claim copyright protection.

The resulting binary from ghdl elaboration is covered under the version of the GPL the particular version of ghdl is distributed under, containing a linked copy of the ghdl run time library.

The program endian.c is not sufficiently expressive while containing non-original expression and no copyright is claimed.
